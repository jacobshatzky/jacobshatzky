            <h1>Youth Digital Gateway - Java</h1>
            <h4>About YDG</h4>
            <p>Youth in Canada are more connected than ever before — they grew up on the internet. When asked about their experience with Government of Canada websites, words like "confusing", "difficult to navigate" and "not user-friendly" come up. </p>
            <p>The Youth Digital Gateway is designed to help youth reach their potential through, Getting a job or gaining experience, Exploring careers and building skills, and Planning education </p>
            <p>Users are able to: Search for a job on a Job Bank, Find a summer job, Explore career options based on employment trends, Explore your career options by degree of diploma, Gain experience through Youth Employment and Skills Programs, and Volunteer or serve and build your skills.</p>
            <p>This is all possible in our centralized Youth Digital Gateway!</p>

            <h4>Implementation</h4>
            <p>Use of Spring Tool Suite with Java and Maven for the back-end, Javascript and React in the front-end. Azure Devops to host and manage the website</p>
            <p>I worked on many layers of the API. The entity model, which represents a table in a relational database, we implemented a SQL script for each API to generate the tables, and the fields in each one. Followed by the repository, that outlines the all the logical read and write operations for a specific entity. The service layer for the client to interact with some functionality of the application. The controllers that controls the flow of the data and process incoming requests then returning the data that is requested.</p>
            <p>I started creating entity models for the database, these consisted of all the fields for each table, along with getters and setters, and methods for equals, hash code, and string. I also worked on the services and controllers in the API, this is how the front end would retrieve data from the back end. I worked on every layer of the API, the mappers/assemblers, the controllers, services, repositories, Dto’s, and the entities. Furthermore, every part of each API needs to be tested to ensure everything is working the way we intend. Generally you want to have 80% code coverage from unit tests. I worked on the unit tests for each API, this means each entity, controller, service, and model needs to have unit tests, for each field and method which can quickly add up. I ended up writing approximately 400 unit tests for each resource and program API, as well as 800 for the opportunity-finder API. Most of these tests were standard checking to ensure data was retrieved as expected, as well as some checking the endpoints and making sure the controllers were working. All this testing provides the coverage we need while more importantly, finding bugs.</p>

            <h1>Machine Learning POC - Python</h1>
            <p>Proof of Concept with Machine Learning. At CRA, there are large and complex IT systems that generate different types of logs including security logs (generated by IT applications, databases, networks, infrastructure), audit logs, lower state logs, information logs, debug logs, amongst others. For instance, IT security logs are created when any of the following activities are requested or performed by the system or an application; authentication, authorization, system or application changes, availability issues, resource issues, vulnerabilities, etc. The generated logs are monitored and managed by various IT areas at the CRA, they are used for analysis, identification of incidents, and reporting. These type of logs could be monitored and analyzed either manually or automatically. We used Machine Learning to automate this process and leverage unique AI models to read and analyze large amounts of data and report issues/anomalies. Using machine learning to build an automated log anomaly detector will allow us to detect anomalies in real time</p>
            <p>We used a combination of unsupervised models, for instance Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, One-Class Support Vector Machine, and more. After this I started looking into more advanced methods, for instance with Neural Networks.</p>

            <h1>Trivia Game - JavaScript</h1>
            <p>Designed a server and client for a real-time multiplayer trivia game using JavaScript and HTML. Implemented radio buttons, text box’s, lists and drop down menus in HTML. The project Used Socket.io to enable real time bidirectional event-based communication between users. I effectively applied the use of the auto-reconnection/disconnection support to determine when new users join or leave the current trivia game. I also Used Node - Express to store previous and current players statistics in a secure database </p>

            <h2>Euchre Card Game - C</h2>
            <img src="euchre.png" alt="" style='float: left; width: 150px; height: 150px;' >
            <p>Each card must be represented by exactly two ‘chars’ representing a rank and suit. The possible rank options are: '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A' . The following functions must be implemented: isValidRank(char c), isValidSuit(char c), and getTrump(). All four users will be repeatedly prompted to enter a card until a valid one has been entered. I had to determine which card/player wins the round. For instance, a card of type trump will always beat a card that is not of type trump. If two cards have the same suit, the highest rank is used </p>

            <h3>Threads - C/C++</h3>
            <img src="threads.png" alt="" style='float: right; width: 150px; height: 150px;' >
            <p>Implemented a program to calculate the number of prime factors of all numbers in a binary text file using threads and Mutex’s. I used an array to dynamically allocate memory for the amount of numbers read from the command line arguments as well as the file name. •	Initialized and used Mutex’s throughout the program to lock/unlock incrementing/decrementing variables so no other thread could execute the same region of code until it is unlocked by the thread who has locked it.</p>

            <h4>Maze - Java</h4>
            <img src="maze.png" alt="" style='float: left; width: 150px; height: 150px;' >
            <p>The program will trace through the maze and count the perimiter of a series of connected pixels. •	If the position to the left, right, above, or below has ink then the program will perfrom a recursive call on the next pixel. •	The program will start on some arbitrary pixel, and determine how many pixels (connected to the starting position) have ink. •	The program checks if there is a wall to the left, right, above, or below, if there is it will not call the function in that direction.  •	After perfoming basic edge cases the program will determine if there is ink on the pixels around it and make a recursive call for instance making a call to the left, computePixelPerimeters(row,column-1);. •	The program will continue to make recursive calls until there are no more pixels left to visit, this is done by assigning a “hasVisited” attribute to every pixel and setting it to true after it has been counted. •	The program will output the perimiter of the series of connected pixels in the grid.  </p>
